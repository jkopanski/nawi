#+title: Nats widgets
#+author: Mad Nat

This project are my custom desktop widgets.  It all started when I
wanted to configure [[https://github.com/elkowar/eww][Elkowars Wacky Widgets (eww)]] to my liking.  By
doing sometimes I wished for more control.  Given that most of the
styling is done via CSS anyway, there is really no point of not just
using underlying GTK directly, in the language of my preference.
Seems that I wasn't the [[https://github.com/Aylur/ags][only one with this idea]].
